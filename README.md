# Sales-Analysis-Case-Study
Imported excel files into Rstudio, developed data model and wrangled data using dplyr and tidyr. Cleaned the raw data and detected missing values. Analyzed sales over time, created summary statistics and developed three visualizations: aggregated sales by year, product categories using ggplot2, and box plot outlier detection labeling using ggrepel.
